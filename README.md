Welcome to my academic webpage. I study cortical microcircuits, recurrent inhibition, and sensory representations using two-photon holographic optogenetics and Neuropixels recordings.

*Combining two-photon calcium imaging to record neuronal activity, and two-photon holographic photostimulation in specific subsets of neurons, we can re-create specific neural codes to understand cognition.*

## üî¨ Research Overview
My research examines how brain circuits dynamically support flexible computations that give rise to adaptive behaviors and cognition at three levels:  
1. **Synaptic mechanisms** underlying input processing and plasticity.  
2. **Feature-specific population-level interactions** shaping sensory representations.  
3. **Learned sensory-motor codes** guiding decision-making.  

- **Ph.D. (Max Planck Buenos Aires):** Showed how adult neurogenesis, neuromodulation, and inhibitory microcircuits enable flexible hippocampal input processing.  
- **Postdoc (UC Berkeley):** Expanded all-optical read‚Äìwrite physiology to recreate sensory codes with high fidelity at scale, simultaneously recording thousands of neurons and perturbing hundreds of functionally defined neurons per second.  
- Using these powerful tools, I have causally dissected (and recreated) cortical computations such as feature completion and feature suppression, with a focus on functionally selective inhibitory circuits.  
- Ultimately, I aim to uncover the circuit principles that govern perceptually guided decisions in awake, behaving animals.
